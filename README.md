Make sure you have the following installed on the server that is running the website: java (JRE8u65 or newer), python2.7, web.py, and a web server of your choice (nginx or apache recommended).

Place the contents of the WebUI folder where you want it to be served. The default for nginx on Ubuntu 12.02 is in `/usr/share/nginx/html/`.
