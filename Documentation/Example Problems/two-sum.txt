Two-sum (POSSIBLE)
		Given a list of numbers, find two that sum to a given number 
	Long form
		Given list<int> x,int s; Find i,j st index(x,i) & index(x,j) & equal(plus(get(x,i),get(x,j)),s)
	Short form
		Given list<int> x, int s, Find indices i,j in x st x[i] + x[j] = s
	could also be:
		Given list<int> x, int s, Find i,j in x st i + j = s
	New form
		Given(list<int> x, int s), Find(index i, index j st index(x,i) & index(x,j) & x[i] + x[j] = s)
	Thought process
		We need to bind i
		Use brute-force, try all possible indices of x
		We need to bind j
		Same thing, try all possible
		Then just check if the two sum properly and return current bindings for i,j if they do
