child_type_int(x) OR child_type(x,INT) OR child(x,y) -> type(y,INT)

we may want to say something like:
type(x,y) means "x has type y"
child(x,y) -> type(y,z) "every child of x is of type z"
type(x,y) & type(z,y) "x and z have the same type"

Theorem needed:
type(x,y) -> type(y,TYPE) "if x has type y, then y must be a type"
