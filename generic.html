								<h3>How does it work?</h3>
								<p>The Mother of All Programs (MOAP) was started in the Fall of 2015 with the intention of developing a program that would automatically design computer algorithms. The project was a success in its infant stages, solving a variety of simpler algorithm problems and demonstrating that automated algorithm design is a very real possibility. This is fortunate, because until now, algorithm design has always been the realm of a few very highly-trained, highly-paid individuals in computer science, who are hard to find and even harder to hire. It is our hope that with continued development of this project, we will be able to change this, making algorithm design (and computer science and programming at large) as easy, accessible, and fundamental as mathematics or language is today. What motivates a project of this magnitude? To us, this question nearly answers itself. Librarians, mathematicians, physicists, secretaries, restauranteurs, cab-drivers, dating coaches, travel agents, and countless other professions have all shared one notable change in the past few decades; they are a considerably smaller market share, and are considerably less difficult, than they used to be. From the Internet and Google, to the calculator and Wolfram-Alpha, to a cavalcade of smaller computer programs designed to automate various labors of thought and research, nearly every profession involved with data, planning, or design has found its space encroached upon by some sort of computer program. This advance has been a tremendous boon to all mankind, providing quick, easy, comfortable solutions to problems in an accessible, egalitarian way. The people whose professions were consumed have often been liberated from their own comfort-zones, either moving to fields that better utilize their talents, or finding themselves the managers of a few silicon-based servants that exponentially increase their own productivity and ask for nothing in return. This phenomena is exactly what we seek to bring about in the world of Computer Science itself. If we are completely successful in everything we are striving to do, MOAP will transform algorithm design, which many consider to be the heart of computer science, into something as straightforward and simple as a search on Google or Wolfram-Alpha. It will provide a programming language wherein a user only has to explain to the computer what they want done, leaving the specifics of how to the circuit-boards. There are thus two major problems that MOAP hopes to address:
First, we hope to make high-level programming possible for individuals who aren't capable of solving the "little" algorithm problems they may come across. This includes novice programmers and logicians, scientists with little programming skill, and even individuals with no programming skill whatsoever.
Second, we hope to "flatten" the algorithm design process for skilled programmers. Similarly to the way online searching has made finding useful code-snippets and libraries almost trivial, we hope to make the creative process of algorithm design just as simple.

								<h4>What is an example?</h4>
								<p>They would first rewrite and formalize the problem into our input syntax:
"Given list a, list b, list c; Find d st child(a,d) & child(b,d) & !child(c,d)"
The program will then output the pseudocode to solve the problem, the most recent example of which is included here:

	na = new HashSet(c)
nb = new HashSet(b)
foreach child d of a
		if !na.contains(d)
			if nb.contains(d)
				return [d]

There are obviously many improvements that could be made to the pseudo-code, but it will solve the problem, and it will solve it efficiently.</p>

								<p>The market for this product is extremely diverse and almost all-encompassing with regards to computer science. Any programmer or future programmer who wants help with algorithm design can use MOAP as an algorithm-design assistant, and as a means of learning algorithms themselves. Specifically, the two groups we hope to target are novice programmers who need help with basic algorithm design, and skilled professionals who want to automate simple, repetitive designs. Direct competition to our project is non-existent; there's nobody anywhere who's ever tried to do what we're doing now with the success that we've had so far.  The closest competitors are code-generators used for testing and paradigm-transforms. These both simply transform one form of code into another, without any form of comprehensive problem-solving happening behind the scenes. Even compilers, which do often transform and improve code, are not attacking the same targets we are; no compiler has ever been used to solve the problem of algorithm design before. We're equally optimistic about other concerns that face every business. As a software product, the material cost of this venture is very low. The advertising potential on the website is very high - allowing us to target ads directly based on the problems our users are trying to solve. Pricing of ads on our site can be done through any ad distribution service. Google's ad service would allow for effective bidding, as could any other company. Aside from ads, a paid version of the software could be made available either through an online subscription or through a distributed program. It is also easy to tier our program, with varying costs for varying levels of access to the full algorithm-solving engine.
